What is extensibility?

The code can do something different in the future than it does currently,
based on the change in requirements, with minimum cost and effort for change.

A piece of code can't be arbitrarily extensible

For for a code to be extensible we have to anticipate, be deliberate, and govern

Who can anticipate well?

There are 3 kinds of people in every team:
1. Those who know software design well but know nothing the domain 
2. Those who know the domain really well but not software design
3. The few who know both really well
(we will politely ignore that 4th category)

The team are often made of group 1 and 2, and group 3 is far less.
Group 3 often is much better in anticipating than the rest of us.
We have to collaborate, find if the extensibility thoughts and concerns are
relevant.
