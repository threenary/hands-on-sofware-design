Tight coupling makes it harder to test and to extend.

As much as possible favor loose coupling and low coupling to make
the code extensible.

Fewer things we depend on lowers the frequency of change

The more abstract (as in an interface) a dependency is the more extensible
the code that depends on it.

But, please don't blindly apply these ideas. The goal should not be to 
create interfaces or abstraction but to be very relevant.
