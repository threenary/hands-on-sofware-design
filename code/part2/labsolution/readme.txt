We are asked to design a remote for an application. The user of the remote should not really concern themselves about what device or appliance they are controlling with the remote. In other words, whether they control a TV, a Fan, or something else, their interaction with the remote should be the same.

A sample code is given with some devices/appliances. More may be added in the future.
First identify some design flaws in the given code. Then, let's design a remote that can work with different devices but without violating good design principles.

Please feel free to edit and evolve the code as you desire. We will discuss the design options that we can think of after the lab time.
