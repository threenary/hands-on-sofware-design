Economic consequences and impact

Characteristic of good design:
-Simple
-Fewer moving parts
-Relevant
-high cohesion
-low and loose coupling

Cohesion:
-like things are together and unlike things are apart
  - context really matters
-code that does one thing and one thing really well
-narrow and focused
-That changes are less frequent
-The cost of change is minimized

Coupling:
-low coupling - we want to depend on fewer things (for any language)
-loose coupling instead of tight coupling (mostly for statically typed languages)

The reason again is to lower the frequency of change

Both low and loose coupling
